I've been having difficulties with node as a package installing system.

Sometimes there is a project that is deprecated, as in it hasent been updated in while.

So when I try to install the package files with node 11, it throws up a bunch of errors.

with nvm

https://github.com/creationix/nvm
I'm able to install different versions of node/npm/nodejs

and use different versions in different shells.

It's a nice tool to use for version control for node/npm/nodejs and I recommend it because of it's ease of use.
