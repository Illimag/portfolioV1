Interaction Design, what is it?

All I know is that it's cross disiplinary.

It's actually not only about Phone and Desktop Interfaces.

There are lots of other kind of interfaces such as automobile interfaces. 

It's about Designing Interactions.

I guess it doesn't nessessary have to do Humans.

So it's not specific like Human-Computer Interaction Design.

I'm not actually that sure what it's about.

But it's a good idea to start thinking about senior project type things.

An Working Automobile Interface Prototype would be a great place to start.

But maybe that would just be a really great project.
