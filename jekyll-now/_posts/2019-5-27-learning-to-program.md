Learning to program was one of the hardest thing I had to do.

Mainly it was difficult because I really didn't know anything,
so I just had to jump in and hope for the best.

I started with HTML because of my background as a graphic and UI/UX Designer.

Learning web programming languages really opened my eyes on what was happening behind the browser.

I just jump in with a template. I tried my best to build something around it.

I really didn't have any idea what I was doing. 

I kind of tried to reverse enginner the website.

At the start I was limited in what I could do based on what the template had.

So eventually I starting putting templates together, based on the functionality.

But this ended up with a code base that was really messy.

But what can I do.

Because being a self taught programmer ment that the only way I could learn was by practice.

Theory was completly out of the picture it was all action.

I asked lots of stupid questions on stackoverflow and now I cant ask anymore questions.

My account got flagged for asking too many stupid questions.

It was really a process where most of the time I was just getting used to the tools.

Over time I learned with people for example Matthew Hamu who was someone who greatly influenced me as a programmer.

42 school and Coding Dojo, and being in the bay area I have met my fair share of 
developers and enginners.

My dad spent a few days with me teaching me some basic C.

But overall it was me sitting on a computer for basically the whole day non stop.

Without breaks, not getting paid, just grinding it out for no immediate incentives.

I would and I still do programming the whole day, as well as programming sat and sundays.

I've got to a point where I can say I am no longer a beginner programmer.

I caught on new languages an concepts easily.

I can write simple functionalities and logics.

I can debug and have seen a good amount of errors, where I can confidently 
try to fix.

My main focus is in where I started which is web programming.

As so I am knowledge able about HTML/CSS.

I do have a fair amount of understandimg with these and can a web page from scratch
without a framework or library.

Funny enough I think I'm more comfortable writing in C than Javascript.


But logic is logic and so I can program simple scripts from scratch easily.

I am also familiar with essential progrMming basics such as git, version control and 
dependencies.

My ideal developer environment is a UNIX based terminal.

I like to use a Windows OS and the WSL which is a subsystem for windows
that lets you run a ubuntu terminal on a windowz 10.

But because sometimes this causes issue so I also have linux os machines.

I've been putting time into learning more backend.

For example databasws


Databases such as using mysql, nosql, sqlite.. but mainly just a standard mysql database.

Recently I have learned how to write in python using json format files.

As welp as being able to install dependencies thay are essential for builds.

I've gotten a basic understanding of what is going on inside the computer.

Software and hardware.

It just shows me how much I dont know, but that it is OK not to know everything.

I have tried my best to enjoy this process but it has nog always been enjoyable.

It has been a difficult journey learning to program.

Programming is not easy and I am still not even close to being really proficent in any sense of the word.

But I am really grateful to be able to learn and have tried my best to learn.

I am happy to be able to write my own scripts, create use cases and create applications.

So far everythiNg I have created has been used in a very small scale.

But still beikg able to see it in action has been one of the key motivations to keep going.

It was really difficult to learn how to program.

I kind of sometimes had to steal time away to learn.

Putting my other responsibilities aside to keep learning and learning.

I didnt know what would happen on the other side but I kept going and kept learning.

This was not a short process. It was something that I am
glad I coupd dedicate months and years to.

I still have much to learn but I wanted to take this moment to 
be really grateful to be over this small hill. 

I can program.
