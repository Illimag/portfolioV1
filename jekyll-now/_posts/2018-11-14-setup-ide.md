These IDEs are very useful and have alot of features.

I'm glad that I don't have to compile C programs anymore with the command line.

But I think it gets confusing having so many options.

I think you can probably code with just notepad or word, maybe just even pen and paper.

But I think I'll be using certain IDEs for Software Development.

I recommend:

JetBrain's WebStorm for HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Autocomplete is really useful

JetBrain's CLion for C/C++ - Complies and debugs for you

RStudio for R - To work in R

Visual Studio 2017 for Xamarin - So unbelievably useful

I hate paying for software but some of these programs are so handy it's worth paying the money.

But probably a good idea just to stick to one.
