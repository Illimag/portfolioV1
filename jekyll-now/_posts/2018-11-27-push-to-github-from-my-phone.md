I can program from my phone.

With Termux, I can do linux commands as well as vi.

I can also install packages.

I installed git and clang.

So I wrote a C program and compiled it and then pushed it to my github.

To be able to save the file with vi, I installed Hacker Keyboard.

To be able to use the Esc key.
