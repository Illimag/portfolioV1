Very nice.

I found out about keybase because I was looking into where the Stellar Lumens Developer community is located.

They told me to install Keybase and now I have Keybase!

So basically I can send PGP messages and also its like a encripted version of Github.

Haha also you can login from the TOR Browser!

Wow that's pretty cool.

But anyways I was looking into Stellar Lumens because I am interested in running a Stellar Lumens node.

haha
