I have decided to turn this back into a public blog..

There are many reasons why I may want to hide what I think or feel from the internet.

But honestly, I don't think alot of people actually care enough to read this.

Even if they did, if someone decided to judge me just based on what I say on here..

And decide certain things about me, then that is a very shallow way to think about people.

I am so much more than just the things I post on my Github blog..

I have a life outside of Github.

If someone thinks that just because of my Github, I am not a good enough person.. then maybe I am but I don't want to be around people like that.

Also I'm not really doing anything.. that needs me to be so private.

Even if I was, let's be real.

Does it matter, to hide my feelings?

I'm just a person.

This is a journal.

I'm 25 years old.

Let's just see how many Blog Posts I can do.
