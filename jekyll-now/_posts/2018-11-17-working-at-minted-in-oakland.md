Minted is a company that sells Holiday Cards, and Home related items such as custom stockings.

It is community based and all the artwork is custom created by a network of artists around the world.

I am a seasonal Print Quality Design Associate aka Quality control.

The job is easy and nice, also the work is good.

It is a nice job.
