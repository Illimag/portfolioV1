I really like programming.

Actually I like writing.

When I was a kid, I wrote a whole book series. 

It was for fun, it was a non-fiction.

I think there are some key differences between software enginnering, software developing, programming, coding.

I actually think programming is really straightforward.

I am actually starting to think I'm more interested in learning math.
