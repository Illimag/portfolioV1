description: Spending some time on my portfolio site.

Updated my portfolio site with the AngularJS Navigation with iframe src + iOS scroll fix.

For the mobile version of the site currently it is on AngularJS.

For the desktop version of the site currently it is just HTML/CSS/JS with Slider Revolution 5.3, etc.

Will need to spend more time on the desktop version of the site before I move the desktop version to AngularJS as well.

Maybe need to rethink the whole site, because of all the extra code it's bloated and when checking on the console a bunch of the CSS keeps overriding itself because alot of the CSS is hard coded into the HTML instead of putting it into n external CSS file.

This is because I tried to design the website without really planning ahead of time.

Also because I just jumped right into designing and developing the website at the same time.

Because of the bloat, alot of CSS and JS issues are showing up on the console and I think it's slowing down the site.

Because the site is just mainly showcasing static photos, it's important that most of what is uploaded to the user's devices are image files.

I have compressed the files down but even there are still issues with loadtime.

The iFrames are also something I need to think about.

I have been trying to avoid using frameworks for my portfolio site, mainly because Github.io pages doesn't have a backend.

So I created a type of navigation that is similar to the single page applicaiton navigations using iFrames.

But that's causing issues with iOS devices, although it's kind of been fixed it's still kind of buggy also, it's kind of a hack and maybe one day the method I used won't work anymore.

If so that would break my whole site.

There are several other issues such as the quality of the code in general is kind of a mess.

But the design looks good.

Also the UI/UX on mobile is good.

The portfolio pieces are good enough for now.

I hope I will have more time in the future to work more on this, also it was a joy to help many of those clients.

Thanks.
