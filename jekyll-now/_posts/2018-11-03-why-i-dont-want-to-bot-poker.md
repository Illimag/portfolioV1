I've been thinking about what I should do, while cleaning out my office.

Someone told me that there's no point in following regulations, and it's more important in business to focus on making money.

It really makes me sick thinking about how easily that is a slippery slope.

But who really knows.

Yes, it's true that the competition is difficult.

But there really is no excuse for cheating.

Unless it's a game without any rules so then nothing would be considered cheating.

But that kind of game sounds like a mess.

Maybe the reason things are the way they are is because people think just because there are rules it must mean it's similar to a game.

But clearly life isn't a game.

I remember when I was a child I followed rules even when I didn't even comprehend the concept of a "game".

But I also remember that I did things similar to a game to make life easier.

But that was when I was a child and that's when I had no control of my surroundings, so maybe turning life into a game made it seem like in some way I had control over something.

If I taught Simba to not chase after the geese in the park, because the rules are that you can't at that park, maybe he would't have gotten lost.

I don't think making money at someone else's expense is the correct way to do things.

Alot of people are passionate for poker and I think that interrupting their closed circuit games between legitimate human players is ruining their fun.

I think competition is really heating up, probably because of the sun and the global economy.

I bet most of it's artifical.

Someone told me when I was in New York City that it's a war to park your car.

So then Yellow taxis and Ubers are fighting a war with that kind of logic.

No wonder people are shooting themselves over this stuff.

He should have just found a different job, it's all going to be temporary anyways.

I don't have the answers but, no amount of money will bring Simba back, so money isn't.
