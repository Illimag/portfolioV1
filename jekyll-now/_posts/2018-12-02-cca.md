So basically now I'm in CCA again.

So I can see now why I am having such a difficult time getting my foot in the door.

Mh I don't know why I had to overthink it so much.

It would have been easier to just be more straight forward.

BUT now I can code..

Maybe im not a pro. Maybe ill never be a pro coder.

But I can actually code, as in I can write my own scripts.

They arn't the most amazing things in the world.

But it actually took me around 3 years to get to that point.

I am a developer.

Maybe not a great one, but I can setup all sorts of different techs.

My major is Interaction Design at CCA.

Which is like Industrial Design for digitial products.

This is great because I can code.

I can actually develop some of these products..

As well as designing them..

So that means no matter how good an enginner maybe, they will never be as good as me as a designer.

And a designer will never be as good as me as a developer.

Unless they are like me and sank around 1-3 years to learn how to program.

If they did then that's pretty good.

But anyways I just started programming.

Also I realy like programming.

I like designing as well.
