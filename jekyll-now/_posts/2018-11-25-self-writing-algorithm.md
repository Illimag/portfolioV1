I had a idea of a self-writing algorithm.

So instead of writing the algorithm, I would write the algorithm that will write the algorithms..

Or something like that.

I think the main things that would be useful in this method is that, when I write algorithms it may not be the most efficient method.

And/Or there maybe parts of the algorithm that need to be editted depending on numerous factors that can change daily maybe in even miliseconds..

How would I program an algorithm that can change in the miliseconds when typing a single letter takes close to a second.

So I would need to write an algorithm that would write the algorithms in milisecond..

In particular I believe that the algorithm will be more efficent in recognizing patterns, not only more often but faster, as well as making connections that a human programmer may not be able to make in a reasonal amount of time.

There is also another factor: brute force calculations.

Human beings have limits for brute force calculations.

For example: Let's say there is a password that is *** = 3 digits long.

How long would it take someone to write down every combonation of AAA-ZZZ.. On my computer the program competed in 0.292s.

Now what if there is a password that is ******* = 7 digits long.

This may not be able for a human to complete in a reasonal amount of time.

!!@@!!

What if to write a program we have to brute force it, because there is no way we can figure out the answer unless we try every single possible outcome.

An algorithm that writes algorithms would be able to create an algorithm that would maybe be unable to be thought out.. as in there is no way we could have thought our way to it.

When I figure out a way to write this algorithm I want to name it after my dog.
