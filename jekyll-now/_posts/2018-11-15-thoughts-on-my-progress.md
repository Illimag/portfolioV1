Have I developed at all?

Maybe.

I found a book stand on the top of my book shelf and finally am able to not have to hunch over when reading.

My book Mastering R for Quantitative Finance came in the mail.

I haven't even started on the intro.

I haven't even started on C++.

I'm still learning C for Dummies.

Finally got to Chapter 10 in Book 1.

There are like 7 books.

But yeh this is what happened when you have to do things while juggling studying.

Probably got to be grateful for the opportunity to even read books now a days.

I don't think alot of people have time to read?

Or maybe reading was never really thier thing?

I don't know for sure.
