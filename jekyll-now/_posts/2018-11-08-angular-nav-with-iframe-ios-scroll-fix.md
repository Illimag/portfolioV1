Finally got it to work, took 2 days.

Mainly the issue was that on Android platforms the AngularJS NAV + iFrame SRC worked.

But on iOS platforms the iFrame wouldn't scroll.

This seems to be a bug related to the iOS platform and iFrame.

Had to do a work around.

Luckly the work around seems to not effect the Android platform so this is a cross-platform solution.

As well as working on: Safari, Chrome, Firefox Browsers.

One of the main reasons why I decided to integrate iFrames into the AngularJS NAV is because of SEO purposes.

If the single page application is developed with standard practices with the HTML injected by the JavaScript, the Search Engine Spiders have a hard time indexing it.

I have read articles where it says that the Search Engines are improving their algo to be able to index the JavaScript, but I have read an article stating that there still is a delay to this development.

Will create more detailed documentaton.
