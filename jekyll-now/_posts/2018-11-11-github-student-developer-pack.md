I got approved for a Github Student Developer account!

https://education.github.com/pack

Thanks Github :)

I'm in the middle of school and trying to make money to go to school which is a strange place kind of like purgatory.

But I have been working since I started school when I was 17.

I'm 25 years old now.

So its been 8 years.

These 8 years I've went to serveral school.

Ohlone College in Fremont, California to take college credits during High School.

Hongik University in Seoul, South Korea studying Industrial Design.

De Anza College in Cupertino, California studying Graphic Design.

California College of the Arts in San Francisco/Oakland, California studying Industrial Design.

Now I am still in the De Anza System and also my plan is to finish a degree at Ohlone College called Associate in Science in Mathematics for Transfer.

After talking to the counselor she says that if I finish this degree at Ohlone then I have guaranteed transfer to a State school.

I want to go to San Jose State University for Software Engineering, for my bachelor degree.

I really enjoy programming and want to learn more in a formal setting.

Also I enjoy maths.

I had a hard time with maths because of personal reasons but it wasen't ever maths fault.

I want to learn maths to apply it.

I think math is very useful in life.

I want to do my masters and even a doctorate.

I want to do this not because of money or because of status, but because I want to learn advanced subjects.

I am interested in studying subjects such as quantitative finance/mathematical finance, computational finance, financial engineering, machine learning, artifical intellegence, data science, etc.

My dream is to build an AI that can predict the market to a high margin of sucesses.

I want to do this because of many reasons.

But mainly, I am thinking about for example my kids, or grandkids or my sister's kid or grandkids or my friend's kids or grandkids.

I want to make a trust where our kids can get money to go to school.

And this won't ever stop, until the program stops.

Going to school with the stress of financial problems is really not good.

I hope my kids don't have to deal with that and they can study what they want without having to deal with thinking about money while doing it.
