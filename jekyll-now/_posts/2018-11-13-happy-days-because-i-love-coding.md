I've been coding for maybe a bit over 2 year now.

Here is a short story about how I got into programming:

My educational background is in Product Design and Industrial Design.

I went to university in Hongik University in South Korea.

Then transfered to California College of the Arts in San Francisco, California.

I took a break from school.

I found an internship in San Francisco for a mobile application startup.

Worked to a graphic UI & UX position.

Spent another year working at various startups, clients, etc.

During that year I learned HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Then I learned C.

I want to learn more math.

I took AP Calculus AB in High School.

I want to graduate my Bachelor Degree in Software Enginnering.

Then I want to do my Masters Degree in something like math related.

I want to study as far as a Doctorate Degree because they get access to research materials.

I want to do things such as building a machine learning model that can predict climate change.

I need some help, but I think I'll be okay for now.

I bought these books from Amazon:

Introduction to R for Quantitative Finance

Mastering R for Quantitative Finance

Advances in Financial Machine Learning

Remember to keep learning.

Also specialization is only important for work related, to keep competitive.

Learning should never stop, and remember to never restrict your learning.

A janitor can program if he wants, even if he won't get a job as a programmer.

Because there is more to life than work.

Also Global Warming.
