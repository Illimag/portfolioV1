Dont worry.

But make sure to finish up your Bachelors as well as the Associate's.

Bachelor's in Art - Interaction Design

Associate's in Science - Computer Science

Then just focus on your portfolio.

Fill it up UI's that you design from scratch and then develop from scratch.

Use frameworks, keep up with new tech.

Use the most recent version of JavaScript frameworks, etc.

As well as learn how to do front-end on mobile applications.

Such as Java, Swift, and C# with the Xamerin Framework.

If you do this then, you'll be fine.

Take your time.

UI Enginner is what I want to aim for.

I have an advantage because most people in that field will be STEM.

But I'll be an ART major with an A.S in Computer Science.

So if the portfolio will be unique, then you'll always have the competitive advantage compared to Enginnering majors.

Don't compete with software enginners, no point.
