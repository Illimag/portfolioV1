My Ideal Company/Department is one that has around 50-200 individual. I want to find a company where I can work for a consistent time. If I could I would like to work at one company for over 30 years, basically till I retire. I really think that over the period of 3 years, I have experienced mistreatment in the workforce and it has made me want to find one good one and stay put for good. There are risks to that of course, things such as complacency and maybe the chance that the company going down. But no matter how large the company there always is that chance.

My hopes are that once I graduate from California College of the Arts, I will have an Portfolio I will be happy to show people, as well as this blog I am hoping with the right SEO in a couple of years it will help my brand identiy. I will also have a degree and a resume with work experience. I want to find a really great company and a role that I can fit in well.

It might take a while, but I'm willing to take the time to make that happen. When it does I think I will be happy to have a job that is steady, a company that is great, and a career that I love.
