Today I had a realization.

My books came in the mail:

The Art of Computer Programming V1-4A By Donald Knuth

Writing software is easy.

It's like learning a foreign language.

I think anyone can write software, if they tried.

The tools are just tools of the trade.

But the math is hard.

Knowing the math behind the algorithms.. vs calling prewritten functions out of the machine.

Because, everything in software starts at 0 and 1.

I'm glad I got to this realization.

Thank you.
