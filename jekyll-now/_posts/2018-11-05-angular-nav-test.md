The Angular framework is very nice. I like how the website changes pages more smoothly because all the assets are preloaded.

The downside is that it takes a while at the start to load, the upside is that once the assets are loaded it will be in the cache.

I used the iFrame method to change urls when the tab is selected.

I think that one of the main issues with using AngularJS for websites is that web crawlers have a more difficult time indexing them.

So if you are planning to have your website's SEO effect your internet traffic, a single page application type framework would make the site not SEO friendly.

With iFrame method I am able to keep the html in pages that are able to be indexed like a non-framework website.

I do not think this is a good way to do things, but for something that is simple like my portfolio which is just a bunch of static photos, an AngularJS framework navigation that changes URLs when each tab is seclted, is an OK solution.
