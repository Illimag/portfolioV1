Here are the classes I'm taking Fall 2019 at California College of the Arts for Interaction Design.

1. IxD 1: Foundations
2. Visual Interaction Design
3. Prototyping
4. Computational Practices 1

The semester starts in September.

1. 
Title	
IxD 1: Foundations

Course Section Number	
IXDSN-200-01

Course Description	
IxD 1 Foundations describes and examines the fundamental principles, materials, and processes that undergird interactions between people, as mediated by technology, artifacts, and systems. Students are introduced to a variety of tools, theories, and techniques that facilitate the crafting of designed interactions that take place across a wide spectrum. Through interface design of interactive canvases such as mobile, desktop, car, game, console, kiosk, and apps, students will gain an appreciation for the application of interaction design principles and tools, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and the prior and subsequent steps to using them. Purpose of this course: Students will learn about the foundational concepts, methods, and practices of the interaction discipline.

2. 
Title	
Visual Interaction Design

Course Section Number	
IXDSN-230-02

Course Description	
In the Visual Interaction Design course, students will focus on the conceptual and practical fundamentals of visual aesthetics associated with interaction design. ï¿½This course is comprised of two parts: visual design fundamentals, and how they are applied in the context of Interaction Design. Color, typography, and information hierarchy are emphasized in this course. Purpose of this course: Students will learn about the visual design fundamentals they will need throughout the rest of the Interaction Design program and in the professional practice of interaction design.

3. 
Title	
Prototyping

Course Section Number	
IXDSN-250-01

Course Description	
This course will introduce and explore prototyping from all aspects relevant to interaction design. Prototyping tools will be introduced from low fidelity to high including sketching to digital to interactive. Prototyping methods and mindset will be introduced. Students will also be introduced to meta-learning, a critical capacity to keep up and evolve as tools and processes do. Finally, students will learn basic evaluative techniques to be ready to go out and learn from the world how effective their designs are and how to evolve and improve their designs. Purpose of this course: Students will learn a variety of tools and techniques to create prototypes for evaluation and consideration during a design process.

4. 
Title	
Computational Practices 1

Course Section Number	
SCIMA-212-02

Course Description	
Science and Math (SCIMA) courses develop students' capacity for evidence-based reasoning through the study of life, earth, and physical sciences and of computational and theoretical mathematics. In these courses, students learn to recognize and interpret meaningful patterns of information; to assess the validity of empirical claims, distinguishing between opinion and fact; and to understand the sociocultural relevance of scientific and mathematical thinking. An additional materials fee will be charged for this class.

Section Description	
This course introduces students to basic concepts and techniques of computational practice, primarily through designing and developing screen-based interactive visual work. Technology touches everything we do today; this course aims to help students understand how this occurs, where the frontiers of computation lie, and how to find opportunities for pushing their disciplines forward. In this course, students will develop an intuitive understanding of encoding process into computer programs and skill at building new tools that enable new ways of thinking about, exploring, and understanding the world. Specific topics will include abstraction, iteration, hierarchy, data modeling, simulation, visualizing data, designing systems, and debugging programs. These concepts will be introduced and reinforced using the JavaScript language, the p5.js framework, HTML, and other foundational technologies in common professional use. A final project requires that students develop a relative depth of expertise in those technical areas touched by the project. High school level competence in algebra is assumed.
