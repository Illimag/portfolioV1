I'm really enjoying studying programming with the C computer language.
With Emscripten SDK:
http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/
You can compile C into a WebAssembly file and a JavaScript file that runs it.

It was really cool to be able to run a C program that I could run with nodeJS.

Running C from R
~/excercises/language/r/calling_c_with_r/README.md
Calling a .C from the R shell was really cool to be able to do that.

I'm really happy learning more about the C language.

I hope I get more time in the future to learn and then be able to write C programs.
