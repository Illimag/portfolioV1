description: Starting my own business

I've done work to make money.

Maybe I've done this for a while now. 

The funny thing is that I'm not even that old.

But I feel very old.

Maybe I'm burned out.

The truth is that I worked at Walmart for one day and then quit.

Why did I quit working at Walmart?

The truth is that I can make money.

It's a crazy thing because I don't really know anyone else that can do this on a consisent basis.

The ones that do are seriously kind of having a hard time but it's a really hard path.

The funny thing is that I've met people who worked the "normal" full time career path and ended up in a bad way.

Life is truely unpredictable and we can never be sure about wether there will be a tomorrow.

But full time jobs mean "security".

But the truth is that no one is really safe.

Anyways enough of the rant. 

The main advantage that I have to the competition is that I can write computer programs. 

As a business man that is a massive advantage.

Because the funny thing is that there are computer programmers that can't write computer programs.

Life is ironic.
