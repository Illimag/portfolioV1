I'm planning to start Calculus at an Community College near my house.

Because my degree is an Associate in Science in Mathematics for Transfer (ADT) I want to take my first math class in Pre-Calculus or Calculus.

So I created a new folder named "maths" in the excercise folder.

So far I have installed the R language and RStudio to allow me to write scripts to calculate Calculus problems with a computer.

Looking forward to learning maths.
