Ok, so currently I do have a portfolio.

But it can be better.

The problem was that I was focused on making money.

As in I would get people who needed work done and then do it.

So my portfolio would show that.

There arn't any really advanced things. Mainly all I did was work with WordPress and basic things of that
nature.

Alot of times I didn't even make a draft. I just went right in to finish it as fast as possible.

So there really was no work of progress or sketches and things like that.

There still are a couple of portfolio pieces I can put in but I think it will be better if I just start over from scratch.

As in I want to do my portfolio with an idea in my mind of what it will compile of at the end.

But most importantly of all, I need to make really good documentation.

Because otherwise how will people be able to see the thought process.

Some of the things I want in my portfolio are things with JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS.

But I really want to put as many different products in as possible.

I will sketch out the concepts and design the user interface, as well as focusing on the user experience.

Then I will develop the UI with code, depending on what I decide to code it with. I will also do the backend.

I am hoping that the back-end will be simple. I do not plan to have any live products. These will all be only demos.

As so I can just put in dummy data in a Json or exel sheet.

Then I can append it or create an API to connect it to the front-end.

To make it as cost efficent as possible, I want to host my own servers to have them running.

Also I think it will be very good to have my school projects on here.

That means I will need to take my school projects more seriously.
