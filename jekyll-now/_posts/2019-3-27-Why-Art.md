This is a post about why I chose Art of all things to pursue as a career.

I love art.

There have been many times in my life where I regretted my decisions as well as second guessing myself. Especially because of the nature of competition, there always is someone better than myself.

They say that if there is something you love doing, then it really isn't about competition anymore.

But of course to pursue it as a career is something completely different. You need to be competitive. 

Maybe Art is more of a hobby. Even if you are good at it.

That is why, I started my education as an Industrial Designer. But because of the nature of the industry around the Bay Area, I am studying Interaction Design now. To be able to pursue Art as a career, requires you to sacrifice as well as be honest and practical.

But it's competely do-able and being able to make it as an artist is rewarding, more than compensation. 

But to be honest there are artist who make more than programmers. Not exactly sure how the statistics work out. But here in San Francisco and Silicon Bay Area, Tech Workers get paid alot, but in other places in the world, things are more even.
