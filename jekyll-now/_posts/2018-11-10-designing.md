I don't know anything about what suppose to be a certain way.

Basically I just make a guess based on intuition.

I think my intuition is not really good alot of times.

It's like when you stare at a drawing that you been working on for hours and visually it starts all looking the same.

Also maybe one day something this and the next day something that.

I think there must be a scientific approach to find out the best design principles.. but I think things change alot.

Maybe it just ends up being a style and some people will like it and some people won't.

Luckly we are able to make our own judgements on it, like art.

No one is right and no one is wrong?

But there must be a type of true or false methodology for design.

I think it's hard to say for sure until there are tests done..

Also it depends on the type of user.

If the user is blind, then everything I've been doing has been a horrible design practice for their use case.

Ok, remember to make a handicap access able type UI/UX for that use case, so even a blind person can visit the website.
