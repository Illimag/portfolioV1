I already had a Samsung account.

But now I signed up for the Samsung Developer program.

So I can create applications for their app store.

It's free unlike the google and apple play store.

Also they give me discounts for products on their website.

Also I downloaded their IDE for developing.

They use Web technologies such as html/css/js

and also c/c++ for native applications.
