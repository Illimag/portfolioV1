Got a moment to sit down and organize some of the materials that I have been preparing.

I am looking foward to going through the following books:

C ALL-IN-ONE DESK REFERENCE for DUMMIES by Dan Gookin
Which is made up of 7 books:

Book 1: Hello, C

Book 2: Middle C

Book 3: Above C level

Book 4: Advanced C

Book 5: Disk Drive C

Book 6: The Joy of Linked Lists

Book 7: Appendixes

The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie (Second Edition)
Dennis M. Ritchie developed the C language.

Standard Version of Starting out with C++ by Tony Gaddis (Third Edition)
C# Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design by Barbara Doyle (Second Edition)
I am planning to learn C/C++/C#, with emscripten I can compile C/C++ code into JavaScript that run on the browser.

I enjoy writing JavaScript for the web and there are many great tools that have been written around JavaScript.

But I like C/C++ because for example you can declare short or long variables in C.

With C# I can start writing native cross platform applications with Xamarin.

I am not sure what language is best or more useful. I think it depends on the situation.

I enjoy designing and developing websites, but I am more interested in math.

Other languages I am interested in learning in the future are Python, R, and MATLAB.

I have gotten these books for practicing algorithms:

Algorithm Challenges, the Dojo Collection by Martin Puryear
10,000 dollars for this book.

The bootcamp was not worth it for me unfortunatly.

Most of the information could be found online and 3 months is not enough time to learn this material.

Maybe can be proficent in knowning how to use the tools in 3 months.

Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Coremen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein (Third Edition)
Essential Algorithms a practical approach to computer algorithms by Rod Stephens
I have gotten these books to prepare for the interview:

Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (Fifth Edition)
Think like a programmer: An introduction to creative problem solving by V. Anton Spraul
I think if I go through these books, as a programmer I will become more proficent.

I have other books as well, ready to start reading those as soon as I finish this list.

I am very looking forward to reading my other books as well, I bought them from half price books store and barns and nobles.

I have a membership card that I paid 20 dollars for a yearly membership that gets me 10% off on all purchases in barns and nobles.

There is a Starbucks coffee at the Barns and Nobles at Stevens Creek in San Jose.

So the Starbucks coffee is 10% off there.
