description: What I am planning to study at University

Currently I am a Student pursing a BFA in Interaction Design at California College of The Arts (CCA) in SF.

Before this I attended Hongik University for Industrial Design and Product Design.

Here are some of my interests for the future.

Human-Computer Interaction Design, User Experience Design, Graphical User Interface Design, Full-Stack Web Development and Product Design.

I'm thinking about building up my portfolio of products. So I would be first designing it based on the needs of the end user. Usually it is a human being. The products will be related to the Technology Industry. There are several reasons why I have decided to work on products that are related to the Technology Industry. 

1. I am a local to the Bay Area and San Francisco as well as Silicon Valley is here.

2. Digital products have an amazing production cycle as well as being something that is easier to distribute than physical products that need to be shipped.

3. Digital products because of the nature of software, makes it increasingly easier to more complex things as time goes by. But because it can be as simple as copy and pasting a whole folder system, compared to trying to mass produce physical products. 

Originally I was going to school for Industrial Design at California College of the Arts as well. Because I transfered in from Hongik University with the same major. But after I took a 3 year break from school to get some industry experience, it became easier for me to understand that this area is known for software/hardware, Technology Products.

As so I started with an Internship at a Startup in SF. They were building an mobile application. I was hired as an office hand, but eventually worked in a Graphic and UI/UX Design role. There I began to see how my skills can transfer over to working on products that are inside a phone screen. But it was a very difficult time for me as for 3 years, I worked while self-studying programming.

I learned basic web programming languages such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I have a very basic understanding on how these technologies work together. But I am happy to say that I have reached a certain level of proficency with hacking together pieces of code together. As well as putting things together from near scratch. I have alot of appreciation to programmers before me who put in all this time and effort to make it possible for the future generations.

Now that I have a drawing pad, I can sketch out concepts that are in my head and draw them directly into the computer screen. Then I use Design Software such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to design polished interfaces. I know that there are rapid prototyping tools such as proto.io and Adobe XD. But instead of spending time on building prototypes with static images, I have learned to just build the frontend of the application with code. A simple HTML/CSS/Javascript web application front-end is something I can put together in somewhat of a decent speed. 

What I am really looking forward to is learning about about Interaction Design at school. I really believe getting a degree in Interaction Design will really open my eyes to what is possible for User Experience Design. I am getting a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Interaction Design. So it will be more on the creative side, rather than a scientific side. But I still believe an Graphic User Interface will have many aspects of Arts, just as many aspects of science. Even though yes we can break everything down in a scientific method, to be able to be creative and think up concepts that are truely unique maybe just as useful.

I plan to spend the next two - three years in deep thought and practicing my craft. Because my ultimate goal is to be a very well rounded Product Designer. One who can understand Human's Interaction with Computers to a deep level and be able to come up with Graphical User Interfaces and then build the Front-End as well as the Back-End of the Web Application. 

I understand I will need alot of help along the way, and hope I will be able to complete my goals.
